# Kenney Tiny Battle Asset Pack

This addon repackages [Kenney Tiny Battle](https://kenney.nl/assets/tiny-battle)

In addition to the base tileset, includes some terrain mapping to help use the mapset better.

Terrains include:
 * Grass
 * Water
 * Road
 * Arrow

The ground and water tiles are a "Corners and Sides" or "Mixed" tileset, but doesn't seem to include
_every_ possible tile. But there's more than enough to make complete and compelling maps. :)
